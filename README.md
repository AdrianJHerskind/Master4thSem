Title: "A shared control approach for obstacle avoidance in robot supported USAR"

Written in Spring 2021 with Karolina Dudzinska

Code includes:
1) Shared Control supervisory system: (C++)
   a) Allocating control to robot or human operator through FSM based on distance to obstacles
   b) 3 levels of Autonomous Obstacle Avoidance:
       i) Feedback Supported Teleoperation
       ii) Semi-Autonomy
       iii) Full Autonomy
2) Localisation of robot in map (Python)
